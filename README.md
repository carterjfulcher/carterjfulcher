I make financial software. Currently, I'm working on disrupting Bloomberg with a better, cheaper, and [web-based terminal](https://v3.godelnum.com): 

Previously I worked in asset management (ETFs), where I solo-developed software that directs over $1.9 Billion dollars. 

I also run a family private equity firm, holding real estate, commerical equipment, and long/short equity positions. 

Below are some open source projects I've contributed to in my free time:
